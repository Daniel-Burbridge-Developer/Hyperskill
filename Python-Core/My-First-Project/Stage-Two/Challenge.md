<h1>Description</h1>
A month has passed since the opening of your shop. Let's calculate the total earnings for this period! You know the total earned amount for each item:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Item name</th>
    <th>Earned amount</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bubblegum</td>
    <td>$202</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Toffee</td>
    <td>$118</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ice cream</td>
    <td>$2250</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Milk chocolate</td>
    <td>$1680</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Doughnut</td>
    <td>$1075</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pancake</td>
    <td>$80</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Use it and find the total income in the first month.
