<h1>Description</h1>
In the last stage, let's calculate the shop's net income. To do it, subtract the staff and other expenses from the total sum. Let's first take a look at the staff expenses:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Staff</th>
    <th>Salary</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cleaner</td>
    <td>$850</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vendor</td>
    <td>$1120</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Manager</td>
    <td>$1300</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Loader</td>
    <td>$900</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Take into account the fact that there is only one staff member in each position. So, you don't need to multiply staff expenses by 2 or 3. There is only one cleaner, one vendor, and so on.

Take a look at other expenses:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Type of expenses</th>
    <th>Cost</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Electricity</td>
    <td>$100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Municipal service</td>
    <td>$90</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Security</td>
    <td>$30</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In this stage, the total staff expenses and other expenses are fed to your program as two inputs.

<h1>Objectives</h1>
In this stage, your program should:

<ol>
  <li>Print the item names and what you earned for each of them;</li>
  <li>Print the total earnings as before;</li>
  <li>Ask users for staff expenses with the Staff expenses: string and for other expenses with the Other expenses: string;</li>
  <li>Calculate and print the net income as shown below. Replace 0.0 with the actual net income:</li>
</ol>

```Net income: $0.0```
